<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>Super interesting thriller movie that explores the themes of greed and class divides.</p>

<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>Coco is one of my favourite Disney movies of all time. The main character loves music, however his family despises it. The main character is able to enter the Land of the Dead and find more about his family's history with music.</p>

<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>This is probably the most saddest Ghibli film to exist. The main characters are a boy and his little sister who are survivors of the Hiroshima bombing that occurred in World War II. </p>
